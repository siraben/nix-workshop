# Nix Workshop Outline
Nix workshop outline, intended for a CS and discrete math-literate
audience without prior experience with Nix.  Knowledge of other build
systems is useful but not required.  Each session should take around 1
hr with time for questions.

## 1. Introduction and motivation
### Motivation
- Development environments
- Building software with dependencies
- Upgrading components
- Installing different versions of software side by side
- Deploying software to other machines and distributions
- Keeping systems up to date, rollbacks
### Existing solutions
- Development environments
  - `virtualenv`, `cabal repl`, `docker`
- Building software with dependencies
  - `brew`, `apt`, `ports`, `npm`, `pip`
- Upgrading components
- Installing different versions of software side by side
- Deploying software to other machines and distributions
  - writing package definitions
- Keeping systems up to date, rollbacks
  - `apt`, rollbacks?

### What can Nix do?
Nix can do all of the above and more.  Elaborate on why I think Nix is
poised to revolutionize DevOps, how it already affects my computing at
home, work and school.

- TODO: add content from Dolstra's PhD thesis on Nix
### A Little Theory
- Refresher on binary relations, directed graphs, graph representation
  of relations, transitive reflexive closure of a relation
- Build time dependency: what is needed to build the software
  - e.g. `cmake`, `clang`, `gcc`, `autoconf`
- Runtime dependency: what is needed at runtime 
  - e.g. runtime libraries
- Transitive dependency: "2nd order" dependencies
- Connection between memory management in PLs and software deployment
  - See Dolstra's thesis
- Go through examples of some project READMEs and ask audience what
  the build time/runtime dependencies are, and guess at some
  transitive dependencies
- Topological sort and build plans (e.g. as used in `make`)
### Discussion questions
- [ ] Install Nix on your system (macOS, Linux, WSL).  Ask around for
      help if you have any questions.
- [ ] Look at one of your own projects.  What does it depend on?  How
      much work would it take to get it to build and run on someone
      else's machine?
- [ ] Bit rot: Did you ever work on a project only to revisit it later
      and find out that it no longer built, despite not touching the
      source code at all?  If so, what was the problem?

## 2. Using Nix
Prerequisite: Nix installed

### Nix CLI
- Installing, uninstalling, upgrading packages
- Generations
  - listing, rolling back
- Nix store
  - querying, closures, generating graphs with graphviz
- Nix shell
  - like `virtualenv`, but for anything in Nixpkgs (up to 60K+
    packages)
  - run software without installing it
  - shebangs and reproducible scripts, with examples
    - generate Vanderbilt CS course dependency graph with pygraphviz
    - concurrent web scraping with Haskell
- Channels
  - Updating channels
### Nix language
- https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/basics-of-language.html
- Nix is a lazy, purely functional language
  - Functional programming, currying, closures
- Nix repl, importing Nixpkgs and library fucntions
- Expressions, sets, builtin functions
- Recursion and recursive sets
- Interesting: show the PR that implements topological sort in Nix
### Discussion questions
- [ ] Look at one of your own projects. Can you enter a Nix shell that
      lets you build and run it?
- [ ] Implement the factorial function in Nix using `lib.fix`.  Extra:
      could you define it without `fix` (Hint: find the definition of
      `fix`).

## 3. Packaging with Nix
### Background
- Example in RPM
- Packages are just functions (Nix expressions)
  - Inputs: dependencies
  - Outputs: results
- nominal vs. contractual specification of dependencies (see thesis)
- When can one component be replaced with another one?  Just when the
  name matches?  No! -> Nix uses cryptographic hash to tell them
  apart, so these are all different:
  - glibc-2.3.5 built with GCC
  - glibc-2.3.5 built with clang
  - glibc-2.3.5 + different build flags
  - glibc-2.3.5 + vendor-specific patches
### Practice
- Derivations
  - `mkDerivation` (don't get too deep, refer to salient points from
    Nix pills)
- Build phases, pre/post phases
- Developing with Nix shell
- Shell script to print hello
- Hello world in C
- Autoconf-based projects; GNU Hello, Ed
- CMake-based projects; Powder Toy
- Check your work; `nix build --check`
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
### Discussion questions
- [ ] Build one of the assignments from your CS class by writing a Nix
      expression.  What dependencies did it rely on at build time, and
      at runtime?
- [ ] Think of software you use often that you have installed via
      another package manager, is it in Nixpkgs?  Outline what it
      would take to write an expression for it (bonus points if you
      write a working expression)
